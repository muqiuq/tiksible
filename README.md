# Tiksible - lightweight IaaS tool for MikroTik RouterOS

Tiksible is a lightweight CLI tool designed for managing MikroTik RouterOS device configurations, primarily following to the principles of infrastructure as code.

## ‚≠ê Features
 - Manage hosts and credentials in YAML files

 - Compare local and remote configurations and apply the differences
 - Set up public key authentication with a single command

## üß∏ Motivation
 - I was looking for a simple, lightweight CLI tool to manage my MikroTik RouterOS devices.
 - I needed an efficient way to apply similar configurations to multiple devices.
 - My Python scripts were becoming unwieldy, so I sought a cleaner and more manageable solution.

## üöÄ Upcoming features
 - Sync configuration with MikroTik Router
 - Generate site configuration from existing WgQuick configuration file
